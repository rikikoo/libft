# libft
**school project** The C standard library re-written

This library is comprised mostly of functions that are found for example in `<ctype.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<srting.h>`, re-written completely while complying with the 42 school _norm_ (i.e. no `for` loops, max 25 lines per function, allowed functions are pretty much `write()`, `malloc()`and `free()`). In addition to that, there are some functions that aren't in the standard library, but most likely serve the same purpose as some already existing ones... they've been written from scratch though, as a learning procedure.

The `ft_`prefix is referring to the school's name: *Forty-two*.

## using the lib
running `make all && make clean` will produce a library object `libft.a` that you can add to your compilation process, should you want to try out this lib's functions.
